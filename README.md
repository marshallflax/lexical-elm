# lexical-elm

* elm code for a front-end for assigning words to lexical chains, viewing frequency distributions, etc.

* My first Elm code!
** Still my first Elm code, but 450+ commits in, still trying to determine best practices, etc.  It still does specification of "lexical chains", also computes 2-grams, 3-grams, and 3-graphs.
** Also implements the "Bowling Kata", because that's a thing now, right?

* Lunch.org is the presentation I'm working on for -- you guessed it -- a Lunch-and-Learn at work, if they ever schedule me
